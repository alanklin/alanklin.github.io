I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for pressing humanitarian issues. I graduated from Boston College with an M.S. in Applied Analytics and Williams College with a B.A in both Statistics and Biology.

Currently, I am seeking full-time employment that utilizes my skills in data science, specifically with Python, R, SQL. I am constantly looking to improve my skills. In fact, I'm planning on taking the [Microsoft Certification for PowerBI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/data-analyst-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification) soon! When I'm not working, you'll find me gardening, running, at the gym, playing tennis, cooking, and exploring all that Boston has to offer.

Please feel welcome to contact me if you have any interesting projects! I would love to help out in any way I can.
