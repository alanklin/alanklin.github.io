Tutoring has given me so many lessons in patience, understanding, meeting people where they are, and forming trust and relationships. I really want to see my students thrive and do well, not just scrape by. It is truly a joy to teach. 

I've tutored students of all ages since high school, particularly in the subject of math, but more recently in statistics as well! I can also tutor for the SAT and ACT, as well.

If you're looking for tutoring services, please drop me a message. Or if you have any questions, too. I love to research and figure out how to better distill a complex topic into digestible bits. Let's learn together!
