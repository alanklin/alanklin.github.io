This project was completed alongside Trevor Petrin, a fellow Boston College graduate student in the M.S. in Applied Analytics program, as our final Capstone Project. It was also presented at the Third Annual Analytics and Industry Symposium in April 2025.

The Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/alanklin/AA-Capstone), but I will also document each week's progress through this end-to-end machine learning model.
