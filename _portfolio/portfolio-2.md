This project was completed alongside Trevor Petrin, Pin Lyu, and Angelo Marinaro, as our submission to Boston College's Back to BC Case Competition Fall 2024. We won 1st place for our ability to present our work to a non-technical audience, displaying a fluid and strong trust in our teammates to work on a difficult problem.


Sponsored by RCG Global Services, a total of 7 teams tackled the problem of predicting sepsis onset in hospital patients by applying machine learning techniques onto a dataset riddled with missing values. The main challenges in this project included applying appropriate data imputation methods as well as balancing model performance with the ability to effectively communicate the process and value to the target audience.
